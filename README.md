<p>A distributed version control system is a system that helps you keep track of changes you've made to files in your project.

This change history lives on your local machine and lets you revert to a previous version of your project with ease in case something goes wrong.

Git makes collaboration easy. Everyone on the team can keep a full backup of the repositories they're working on on their local machine. Then, thanks to an external server like BitBucket, GitHub or GitLab, they can safely store the repository in a single place.

This way, different members of the team can copy it locally and everyone has a clear overview of all changes made by the whole team.

Git has many different commands you can use. And I've found that these fifty are the ones I use the most often (and are therefore the most helpful to remember).

So I have written them down and thought it'd be nice to share them with the community. I hope you find them useful â€“ Enjoy.</p>
